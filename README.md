## Background
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy.

## Objective
To inform how to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products by answering their key questions. 

## Business Questions
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Any particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Simpler price range groupings
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- What’s the distribution among users in regard to their brand loyalty?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
